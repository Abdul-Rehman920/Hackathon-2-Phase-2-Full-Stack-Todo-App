# Skill: Spec-Kit Plus Conventions

All specs must use:
- Markdown files in /specs/
- Subfolders: features/, api/, database/, ui/
- Headings:
  ## User Stories
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  ## Technical Requirements
  ## Endpoints (for API)
- Always include user isolation in multi-user features
- Reference other specs with relative paths
